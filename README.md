# Furnitrade

Furnitrade is a web app that aims to provide a clear and efficient furniture trading 
solution for college students living off-campus. Sellers can post, edit and delete
funiture information, while buyers can easily browse by category. They can communicate 
via request forms, without revealing their privacy (contact info, etc.) to public.
